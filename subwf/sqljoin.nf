    Arguments:

    suffix -- suffix to add to right if necessary to avoid non-key clashes

    Notes:
    1. If there is a conflict (i.e. the left table has a non-key 'data'
    and the right has a non-key 'data' and 'data_right' with the suffix
    '_right', then the right keys with higher index have more suffix copies
    appended to them.

    2. sqljoin takes key type into account, so even if key1 == key2,
    they will not be joined (and will not be treated as conflicting and
    thus distinguished with a suffix) unless their class is the same. One
    way this can be an issue is if their types are GString and String.

        Motivation and implementation logic:

        When Nextflow channel items are LinkedHashMaps ("hashmaps"), they are
        similar to un-normalized tables. Items are rows, keys represent the
        column name for that row, and values represent cell entries.

        We can therefore do an SQL-like join on them. A left join, for example,
        keeps all 'left' rows, adding 'right' rows where there is a matching]
        key and null or default values where there is no matching 'right' key.
        If two or more 'right' rows match one 'left' row, then multiple
        rows are produced containing one copy of the 'left' items and one
        copy of one of the matching 'right' rows' items.

        Nextflow's 'join' is similar but importantly different from an SQL
        inner join. Other join types are not available. None operate on named
        keys from hashmaps. We implement a closer approximation to the SQL
        full, left, right and inner joins on Nextflow channels containing
        a single LinkedHashMap item here.

        'keyset': the values in the by keys of a particular channel item (i.e. table row)

        The implementation idea is as follows:

        1. Depending on join type, determine missing keysets that would
        inappropriately lead to rows being dropped and add in empty placeholders.
        For example, for a left join all left rows should be kept. So any keysets
        in the left table not present in the right table must be added as
        placeholders to the right table.

        2. Group the left channel by keyset, giving a [keyset: [list of items]]
        channel. This is necessary because the Nextflow join operator returns
        only the first item from the left channel for each specific keyset.

        3. Use Nextflow cross operator to get pairwise combinations of left
        channel items and right channel items with matching keysets. For example,
        if there are two left items and two right items with a particular
        keyset we obtain:
            [[keyset, [left_1, left_2]], [keyset, right_1]]
            [[keyset, [left_1, left_2]], [keyset, right_2]]

        4. Reformat to produce hashmap-formatted elements:
            [left_1 + right_1]
            [left_1 + right_1]
            [left_1 + right_1]
            [left_1 + right_1]

            Note: the matching keyset will be represented once in the
            resulting hashmaps

            Where there are non-keyset matching columsn in the left and right
            tables, we add a suffix to avoid a clash or (if a blank suffix
            is provided) we overwrite.
