SmokeTest_ProcessTADS
No such variable: resolution -- Check script '/home/benjamin/Documents/hich/contents/subwf/features/TADs/functions.nf' at line: 23

tad_opts.resolution is what we're looking for.
we're passing in a resolution directly rather than a map
Also, it's not clear what a smoke test is -- stub run or just calling it and seeing if it runs without any guarantees?

SmokeTest_AlignerIndex_Full FAILED
`[bwa_idx_build] fail to open file 'hg38_chr19.fa.gz' : No such file or directory`

Figure out solution for downloaded or locally generated resources (references, indexes)
Can we create a small reference, i.e. with just the smallest contig from one chromosome or an entire very small genome?
+ [M129 reference genome (250kb after gzip)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_000912.1?report=fasta)

Ideally should have real Hi-C data, i.e. from [Trussart 2017](Paper/Citations.md)
+ Uses M129 reference genome
+ [FASTQ download site](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/ArrayExpress/studies/E-MTAB-3721/sdrf)
	+ About 9G per sample (2x4.5G for paired-end fastq files), so would need to be downloaded and extracted.
	+ HindIII or HpaII digest 
+ Extracted first 1k reads from the first listed sample

# Changes
+ Matched SmokeTest_ProcessTADS to match updated process interface
+ Added the ~500kb M129 genome to genomeReference resource to test indexing at `assets/referenceGenome/M129.fa.gz` and updated SmokeTest_AlignerIndex_Full to use it instead of hg38_chr19. Test now runs in 4s. Therefore, removed stub run test as it'll hardly be faster than the full run. WARNING: Still using human data that doesn't match the index for this test, which could be deceptive. 
+ Created tool to extract first N lines from gzipped files downloaded with curl to create small test datasets
+ Added 1k-read paired fastq files from Trussert et al.
