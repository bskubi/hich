# Code changes
1. Create a GitHub issue using the "code change" template.
2. Create a git branch named `I[num]-[abbr_desc]`
3. Explicitly define
	1. Scope
	2. Definition of done
# Questions
* Should we have separate "dev" and "main" branches?
* What if highly related work outside pre-defined scope is discovered while working on an issue?

# Scope creep
+ If new related issues are identified during work on an issue
1. Create new GitHub issue immediately
2. Implement out-of-scope changes as a separate issue+branch.
3. Crosslink in new GitHub issue with issue where it was discovered.
