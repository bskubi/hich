Powerful,Orchestration,Orchestrator handles massive number of samples,"A user provides a sample sheet with 1,000,000 samples and runs a stub run of the pipeline on an HPC. A `nextflow run ... -stub-run` command should successfully completely in 8 hours using no more than 128G of memory and 24 cpus.",Large,"It takes seconds to run 1,000 samples, but takes about 6.5 minutes on my desktop to stub run 10,000 samples through the entire workflow. Much slower on ARC, possibly due to time cost of creating all those folders."
