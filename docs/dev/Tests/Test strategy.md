# Test types
## Smoke tests

## End-to-end tests

## Tests of tests (metatests)
* Scripts to download the large test datasets

# Factoring Hich into testable units

Components of Nextflow workflow
* Processes
* Workflow
* Utils
* Containers
* Command line parameters
* Profiles
* Scalability
* Workflow control

Components of Python tool

Runtime
* Run fast tests first, slower tests later

# Infrastructure

## Small test data objects
## Large test data objects
### Downloaders

### nf-test plugins
* None currently, but can be created by putting groovy files in tests/lib, causing them to be added to the classpath.

### Test workflow automation

#### Why not use [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions) to run Hich tests?
* I looked into this on 2025-10-14. **GitHub actions is only free if using standard, free runners. The ones they offer only have 4 CPUs, 16GB RAM, and 14GB storage, which is too little for some of the tests we'll need to run.** [source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-where-workflows-run/choose-the-runner-for-a-job#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories)
* I'm not clear on whether it would be possible or helpful to use self-hosted runners on ARC, but this seems like a can of worms. I'd rather develop 1+ SLURM scripts that test Hich on ARC.

# Key decisions
* Test suite composition
* Automated testing tools
* Workflow to run automated tests
* Test resource management
* Test documentation
* Release governance

# Strategy

* Identify integration points (places where components interact)
* Define scope and boundaries
* Risk assessment to set priorities
* Tooling and environment strategy
	* Test framework (nf-test)
	* Test environment
	* Approach for test data management

- [ ] Explore github actions to set up and run tests
- [ ] Ankify nf-test as we've made significant progress and it's clear we'll use it.
- [ ] Set up dedicated test environment
- [ ] Determine how to do test data management more systematically
- [ ] Inventory existing tests
- [ ] Identify tests that currently fail
- [ ] Identify highest-priority new tests
- [ ] Create build and test script suite for individual containers in the repo
- [ ] Get entire existing test suite functional
- [ ] Get simple Github actions set up to run automated tests of pipeline

# Basics

[**nf-test**](https://www.nf-test.com/) is the automated test suite for Hich.
### tests/assets

* Small test files are stored in folders based on file type (bam, cool, hic, index, etc) and are backed up on the github repo
	* What is the limit on test file size?
* Large test files must be downloaded to `tests/assets/downloads` (in #gitignore) after cloning the repo using `obtain_large_resources.sh` or `obtain_large_resources_slurm.sh` (a simple SLURM runner for `obtain_large_resources.sh)
### tests/contents
* Contains tests with templates autogenerated by `nf-test create`
