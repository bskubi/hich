Install Nextflow, a container or package management solution, and git
=====================================================================

Hich's dependencies may be installed already on your system. If not, here is what you need to install first before working with Hich.

- Nextflow `Install Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html>`_
- One of the following: `Singularity <https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html>`_, `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`_, `Conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_, or `Mamba <https://www.google.com/search?q=mamba+install&oq=mamba+install&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyFAgAEEUYORhDGIMBGLEDGIAEGIoFMgwIARAAGEMYgAQYigUyDAgCEAAYQxiABBiKBTIMCAMQABhDGIAEGIoFMgwIBBAAGEMYgAQYigUyBggFEEUYPDIGCAYQRRg8MgYIBxBFGDzSAQc5NjZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>`_. Nextflow's other `supported container solutions <https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-scopes>`_ may work but have not been tested.
- `git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_ is needed to clone `Hich` from GitHub.
