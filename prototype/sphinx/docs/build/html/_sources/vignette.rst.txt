How to launch Hich stub, humid and full runs
==========================================================================

1. Clone Hich into your home directory.

``git clone https://github.com/bskubi/hich.git ~ && cd ~/hich``

2. The vignette data files and experiment description are located in
``hich/vignettes``. Start with a stub run, which quickly verifies the workflow
is able to run without doing any data processing.

``nextflow run hich.nf -stub-run``

3. Next, do a "humid" run, which auto-downsamples the input data to the first 100,00 reads per file to quickly verify
Hich can process the data successfully.

``nextflow run hich.nf --humid``

4. Finally, process the entire dataset.

``nextflow run hich.nf``
